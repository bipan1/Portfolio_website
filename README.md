# Portfolio_website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases my skills as a web developer and provides an overview of my projects and experiences. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and it relies on AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and SES to handle backend tasks such as contact form submissions.
